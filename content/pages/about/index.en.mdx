I'm a Tech Lead from Brasil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· , currently working at Mercado Libre.

I've been Full Stack ðŸ’» since 2014, where i started my journey with Spring Framework projects written in Java 7 for Server Side and a mix salad of ChaplinJs Controllers with BackboneJs MVVM structure as Client Side. Then I went through Java 8 and Spring Boot architecture, providing REST APIs for AngularJs applications to consume. Then iâ€™m explored the mobile world, worked as Android Developer and iOS Developer.
